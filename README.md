Information about tabbaco was taken from https://www.canadashistory.ca/explore/environment/blackfoot-bacco written by Graham Chandler. 
CSS for gradiant color for background is being generated by http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/

The project is designed based on two colors blue and red from the Blackfoot Digital Libraries logo.
The script is pure JavaScript which is not using any jQuery.
