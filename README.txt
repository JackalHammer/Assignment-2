Our project shows a genuine native blackfoot tribe tabacco Pipe. We tried to display the object in a simple way that drew attention to the object and didn't detract from it. 
We tried to tell a story and display the information imagining it in a way where the format could be somewhat transfered to other objects in the digital museum. We have some
crows in the background because to the blackfoot people they are the most holy bird, and our color pallet we tried to match to the blackfoot digital museum. Because of the way
we chose to display the object, their isn't much interaction but we think it displays the object in a way that lets you apreciate it close up.
