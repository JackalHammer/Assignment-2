			<p> “Ritual use of smoke represents a spirit, like the creation myth where it’s like Napi’s [the Blackfoot mythical creator] breath-you actually see it. These are the connections with smoking. It’s a physical manifestation of the spirit.” says Eldon Yellowhorn, a Blackfoot assistant professor of archaeology  at Simon Fraser University.</p>

		<p> "The beaver bundle was most important to the tobacco societies: it contains every sacred object essential to the tobacco-planting rituals. According to Wissler, beaver bundles are filled with scores of items like beaver skins, a pipe, tobacco seeds and pouches of tobacco, buffalo ribs, tails and hooves, digging sticks, and muskrat and multitudes of other animal and bird skins. " Graham Chandler. </p>

     <div class="info-card card-4">
		<p> The people who grew the tabacco were called beaver men and were the ones who also kept the beaver bundles. They would hold ceremonies when they would plant the tabacco they would also use a fertilizer made of deer, antelope, and mountain sheep dung. They used the dung of these animals because of the belief that since the animals were fast that it would increase the speed of growth of the plants. The ceremonies also included dancing and a feast.</p>

     <div class="info-card card-5">
			 <p>Tabacco pipes were often used in ceremonies ad when people were over. In some ceremonies only the men were allowed to use the pipe while in others everyone was allowed to smoke from it.</p>
